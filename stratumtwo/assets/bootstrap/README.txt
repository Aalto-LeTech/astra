Bootstrap v3.3.6 HTML/CSS/JS framework
with the components that are listed in config.json. 
Not all components are included in order to avoid conflicts with the 
Moodle core CSS and themes.

NOTICE that the Bootstrap container classes have been renamed: 
container to bs3-container and
container-fluid to bs3-container-fluid
(because Moodle uses its own container class for styling and most pages 
already use that container)
